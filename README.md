# SideProject-Speech Recognition

Using a special type of Recurrent Neural Network, I have applied a LSTM network to a simple speech recognition problem. In this case, the model is trained and tested on spoken numbers between one and ten. The model produces fairly accurate classifications; try to speak a digit yourself!

##Dependencies
*Tensorflow
*TfLearn

## Running the program
*Download the program from the github repository
*Record yourself speaking a digit in mp4 format and place it in the folder used for testing
*Run the program using `python demo.py` in your command prompt
